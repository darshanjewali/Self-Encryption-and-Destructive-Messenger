## Project Overview

This project implements a lightweight, highly secure chat workflow:

1. **Authentication:** Users register and log in with a user ID and password.
2. **Client-Side Encryption:** Messages (both text and files) are encrypted entirely on the client using a user-provided cipher key. The server never sees plaintext data.
3. **Transmission:** Encrypted payloads and key hashes are transmitted in real-time via Socket.IO.
4. **Auto-Destruction:** Messages self-destruct based on a Time-To-Live (TTL) countdown and are automatically purged by the API.
5. **Decryption:** Receivers must manually decrypt messages locally with the original matching cipher key.

---

## Quick Start Checklist

1. Install Node.js 18+ and npm 9+.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Start the application with `npm run dev`.
4. Open the frontend at `https://localhost:8080`.
   *(Note: The app runs on HTTPS via Vite Basic SSL to allow Camera/Microphone permissions on local networks.)*
5. Confirm the API is reachable via the WebSocket proxy.
6. Create two operative accounts to test the secure link.

---

## Core Features

- **Real-Time Communication:** Instant messaging powered by Socket.IO with typing indicators and online/offline presence tracking.
- **Multimedia Support:** 
  - 📷 **Camera:** Native webcam capture with a dedicated modal and shutter animations.
  - 🎤 **Voice:** Live microphone recording with an animated waveform UI and timer.
  - 📎 **Files:** Drag-and-drop file uploading with size limits, automatic image compression, and format validation.
- **Military-Grade Encryption:** Client-side AES message and file encryption using `crypto-js`.
- **Key Hashing:** SHA-256 key hashing to verify decryption attempts without exposing the key.
- **Self-Destructing Messages:** Programmable TTL (Time-To-Live) slider for message auto-deletion (1 to 60 minutes).
- **Premium Cyberpunk UI:** 
  - Glassmorphism panels, neon green/cyan glow effects, and modern layout alignment.
  - Custom scrollbars, pulse animations, glitch-in effects, and dynamic slide-up message entry animations.
  - Graceful inline error handling and toaster notifications.

---

## System Architecture

**Frontend:**
- React 18 + TypeScript bundled with Vite.
- Styled with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI primitives.
- Context-based state management (`AuthContext`, `MessageContext`).
- Hosted locally over HTTPS using `@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl`.

**Backend:**
- Express API running on port `3000`.
- Socket.IO server bound to the Express app.
- JSON file storage at `server/data.json` for local persistence. This file is ignored by Git and is created empty on first server startup, so local accounts and messages are not published.
- `bcrypt` password hashing for stored credentials.

**Network Routing (Dev):**
- Frontend dev server on `https://localhost:8080`.
- Backend API server on `http://localhost:3000`.
- Vite proxies all `/api` and `/socket.io` traffic to the backend, bypassing CORS and Mixed Content issues across local networks.

## Backend API

Base URL in local development: `http://localhost:3000` (Proxied via `https://localhost:8080/api`)

### Authentication

**POST /api/register**
- Body: `{ userId, password }`
- Behavior: Creates user if userId is unique.
- Response: 201 Created on success.

**POST /api/login**
- Body: `{ userId, password }`
- Behavior: Validates credentials against bcrypt hash.
- Response: 200 OK with userId on success.

**GET /api/users**
- Behavior: Returns user IDs only (never password hashes).
- Response: `{ users: string[] }`

### Messaging

**GET /api/messages/:userId**
- Behavior: Removes expired messages from storage first, then returns messages where user is sender or receiver.
- Response: `{ messages: Message[] }`

**POST /api/messages** (Legacy fallback for non-WS payload transmission)
- Body: `{ senderId, receiverId, encryptedContent, secretKeyHash, ttlMinutes, fileName, fileType, fileSize }`
- Behavior: Stores message with generated ID and computed expiryTime.
- Response: 201 Created with stored message data.

**DELETE /api/messages/:messageId**
- Behavior: Deletes message by ID.
- Response: 200 OK if deleted, 404 if not found.

### Socket.IO Events

- `register` : Maps a socket connection to a `userId`.
- `send_message` : Transmits payload to recipient instantly.
- `receive_message` : Fired on recipient client when payload arrives.
- `typing` / `stop_typing` : Broadcasts typing status.
- `presence_update` : Broadcasts online/offline status of operatives.

## API Smoke Test (PowerShell)

Run this in PowerShell to validate the happy path quickly.

```powershell
$base = "http://localhost:3000"
$userA = "agent_alpha"
$userB = "agent_bravo"

# 1) Register users (ignore duplicate errors if users already exist)
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "$base/api/register" -ContentType "application/json" -Body (@{ userId = $userA; password = "pass123" } | ConvertTo-Json)
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "$base/api/register" -ContentType "application/json" -Body (@{ userId = $userB; password = "pass123" } | ConvertTo-Json)

# 2) Login
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "$base/api/login" -ContentType "application/json" -Body (@{ userId = $userA; password = "pass123" } | ConvertTo-Json)

# 3) List users
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri "$base/api/users"

# 4) Send one encrypted message sample
$payload = @{
    senderId = $userA
    receiverId = $userB
    encryptedContent = "U2FsdGVkX1_sample_payload"
    secretKeyHash = "sample_hash"
    ttlMinutes = 5
} | ConvertTo-Json
$sendResult = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "$base/api/messages" -ContentType "application/json" -Body $payload

# 5) Fetch messages for receiver
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri "$base/api/messages/$userB"

# 6) Delete sent message
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Delete -Uri "$base/api/messages/$($sendResult.data.id)"
```

## Data Model

Storage file: `server/data.json`

Top-level schema:
- `users`: `Record<string, { hash: string }>`
- `messages`: `Message[]`

Message shape:
- `id`: string (UUID)
- `senderId`: string
- `receiverId`: string
- `encryptedContent`: string
- `secretKeyHash`: string
- `expiryTime`: number (epoch ms)
- `createdAt`: number (epoch ms)
- `fileName` (Optional): string
- `fileType` (Optional): string
- `fileSize` (Optional): number
- `type`: string ("text", "image", "video", "audio", "file")

---

## Encryption and Security Model

Implemented cryptography:
- **Encryption:** `crypto-js` AES with user-supplied secret key.
- **Key hash:** `crypto-js` SHA-256 for verification matching.
- **Password storage:** `bcrypt` hash on server.

Behavioral notes:
- Plaintext messages are encrypted in the client before send.
- Server stores encrypted payload and key hash, not plaintext.
- Decryption happens in the client with provided secret key.
- If decryption fails, UI surfaces invalid key behavior.
- Local Network Safety: Vite Basic SSL (`https://`) is enforced so that WebRTC hardware APIs (`getUserMedia`) are unblocked on mobile devices testing over the same Wi-Fi.

Important limitation:
- This is a local/dev-oriented design.
- In production, move to hardened key management, auth tokens/sessions, database persistence, rate limiting, and HTTPS/TLS everywhere.

---

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

### Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### Start full dev environment
```sh
npm run dev
```

What starts:
- Vite frontend: `https://localhost:8080`
- Express API: `http://localhost:3000`

### Build frontend
```sh
npm run build
```

---

## Windows PowerShell Quick Start

Use this exact flow on Windows:

```powershell
Set-Location "C:\Users\cheth\Downloads\SDC-MainProject\shadow-message-cipher-main"
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Environment Variables

Current state:
- No `.env` file is required to run the project locally.
- The backend port is hardcoded to 3000 in `server/index.js`.
- The frontend dev port is configured to 8080 in `vite.config.ts`.

Suggested production variables:
- `PORT`: backend server port
- `CORS_ORIGIN`: allowed frontend origin(s)
- `DATA_STORE_URL`: database connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET`: session/JWT signing secret
- `NODE_ENV`: environment mode

---

## Available Scripts

- `dev`: Runs frontend and backend concurrently.
- `build`: Creates production frontend build.
- `build:dev`: Creates development-mode build output.
- `preview`: Serves built frontend locally.
- `lint`: Runs ESLint across the project.

---

## Project Structure

- `src/` : Frontend source code.
  - `components/ui/` : shadcn/Radix-based primitives.
  - `components/message/` : Specialized chat components (MessageCard, CameraModal, VoiceRecorderUI).
  - `components/auth/` : Login and registration forms.
  - `components/layout/` : Shared shell components.
  - `context/` : Auth and WebSocket state providers.
  - `pages/` : Full-page route views.
  - `utils/encryption.ts` : Core AES and hashing logic.
- `server/index.js` : Express API server and Socket.IO configuration.
- `server/data.json` : Database storage file.
- `vite.config.ts` : Vite bundler configuration containing SSL and proxy rules.

---

## Operational Behavior

- Current user session is persisted in localStorage key: `user`.
- `sendMessage` encrypts content before transmission via Socket.IO.
- `refreshMessages` loads both inbound and outbound messages for chat continuity on initial load.
- Decrypt flow validates key behavior in UI and keeps encrypted payload untouched in storage.
- Expired messages are removed when messages are requested or dynamically when TTL hits 0 on the client.

---

## Production Considerations

Before deploying publicly, add:

- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB instead of local JSON.
- **Storage:** Offload encrypted file attachments from Base64 strings to an S3-compatible blob storage bucket to prevent memory bloat.
- **Auth hardening:** JWT/session cookies, refresh handling, CSRF strategy.
- **Request validation middleware** and stricter input constraints.
- **Rate limiting** and brute-force protection.
- **Audit logging** and observability.
- **Secrets management** and environment variable strategy.
- **Secure transport (HTTPS)** and reverse proxy setup natively on the server.

---

## Security Hardening Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Immediate):**
- Add strict request schema validation for all routes.
- Add centralized error handling and response normalization.
- Add basic rate limiting for auth and message endpoints.

**Phase 2 (Short-term):**
- Introduce token/session auth with expiration and refresh flow.
- Replace JSON file storage with managed database.
- Add CORS allowlist and security headers.

**Phase 3 (Mid-term):**
- Add audit logging for auth/message actions.
- Add abuse detection and alerting thresholds.
- Add key management policy and rotation guidance.

**Phase 4 (Production-grade):**
- Add full observability (traces, metrics, dashboards).
- Add backup/restore and disaster recovery runbooks.
- Run periodic dependency and penetration assessments.

## Known Limitations

| Area | Current Behavior | Impact | Priority | Suggested Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Storage | Uses file-based `server/data.json` | Not safe/scalable for production | High | Move to PostgreSQL/MySQL with migrations |
| Attachments | Files Base64-encoded to JSON | Memory bloat on large payloads | High | Stream files to encrypted S3 bucket |
| Auth sessions | No JWT/cookie session layer | Limited auth hardening | High | Add secure session strategy and middleware |
| Input validation | Basic field checks in routes | Risk of malformed requests | High | Add schema validation (zod/joi) |
| Rate limiting | No request throttling | Brute-force/spam risk | High | Add IP/user-based rate limit rules |
| Secret key UX | Key mismatch handled at decrypt-time | User confusion during send/decrypt | Medium | Add optional key-strength hints |

## FAQ

**Q: Is this production-ready as-is?**
A: No. It is a strong local/dev baseline and needs auth/session, DB, validation, and security hardening before public deployment.

**Q: Why are messages still visible to sender and receiver?**
A: The UI intentionally returns both sent and received messages for conversation continuity.

**Q: Does the backend store plaintext messages?**
A: No. The backend stores encrypted content and a secret key hash, not plaintext message text.

**Q: Why do messages disappear?**
A: Messages use TTL and are deleted automatically once expiryTime is reached.

**Q: Why do I get a browser privacy warning when opening the app?**
A: To enable Camera and Microphone access over a local network, the Vite dev server uses Basic SSL to create a self-signed HTTPS certificate. You must click "Advanced -> Proceed" to bypass the warning.
